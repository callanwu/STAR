# STAR: Constraint LoRA with Dynamic Active Learning for Data-Efficient Fine-Tuning of Large Language Models
## Overall
We propose a novel DEFT (Data-Efficient Fine-Tuning) method, STAR, to effectively combine PEFT (Parameter Efficient Fine-Tuning) with active learning through criterion revision and model regularization.
