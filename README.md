# STAR: Constraint LoRA with Dynamic Active Learning for Data-Efficient Fine-Tuning of Large Language Models
# Overall
The SCM of ABSA, which is formulated as a directed acyclic graph, is shown in (a). With the SCM defined, we can derive the formula of causal effect. 
As shown in (b), the desired situation for ABSA is that the edges that bring biases are all blocked.

We present a novel debiasing framework, DINER, for neural  multi-variable causal inference.
